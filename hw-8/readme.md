[HW-8 Live Sketch](https://vruebusch.github.io/120-work/hw-8/)

# **HW-8 Response**

## Summary
This week we learned about 'for loops' and 'while loops'. We learned that 'for loops' require the format: ``for(numberVariable;  conditionalStatement; incrementDetails ) {}`` to work and 'while loops' use the format: ``while( conditionStatement) {}``. These are used to simplify code so that unnecessary lines of code aren't being duplicated. In my sketch, you can see how many squares there are and this is possible through the use of 'for loops'. The way I drew my rectangles makes them shrink the closer they get to the bottom and I did this just to add some variety. I made the squares change a random color per frame, but slowed down the frame rate so that the flashing colors weren't so intense.

## Steps Taken
- declared the setup function and draw function
- created the canvas and background
- created 'for loops' which created a pattern of squares
- created the squares' qualities, including how they shrink closer to the bottom of the screen
- randomized the squares' colors using 'let'
- changed the frame rate

## Issues

Because my sketch was rather simple this week, I didn't run into many issues. I had quite a few ideas for this sketch, but I wanted to make sure 'for loops' were being incoorperated, so I chose a sketch that used many repeated squares. I'm sure I will utilize 'for loops' in many upcoming assignments.

## Final Thoughts

I thought this was a very straightforward week and I'm glad I now know about 'for loops' because I'm sure they will come in handy in the following weeks. I want to get more creative with my sketches as I thought this wasn't my best or most creative, so I will try harder to come up with an idea next time.
