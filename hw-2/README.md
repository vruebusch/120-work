```
 Other than that, I made sure to follow instructions carefully and had no issues. It was just very time consuming for me reading through the assignment as I tried my best to understand this new information being presented to me. I'm now understanding things better and hopefully future tasks won't be too challenging or time consuming for me.

#### Anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I'm just excited to see where this course takes me and what I will learn along the way. I know this is only the beginning and it's still cool to see what we can be capable of even at the most basic level. It's like a new way of doing things and that's exciting to me.

#### How did you help classmates with any issues they had?
I have checked in on my classmates' issues to see if I could help in any way, but others seemed to cover it by the time I went to check. I fear that some questions might be too difficult for me to answer in the future, but I'll try my best. I found my classmates' responses to issues helpful even for myself and at some points I looked at others' assignments as a model.
