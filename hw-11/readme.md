[HW-11 Live Sketch](https://vruebusch.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

# **HW-11 Response**

## Summary

This week we were introduced to Object Oriented Programming where you can group objects together using properties, methods, and class. It's a new way to look at objects.

## Steps Taken

Even thought I have not finalized my sketch, here are the steps I took:

- Declared setup function and draw function

- Created canvas

- Created Rain class and filled out its constructors
- ``let`` at the top
- Created properties and methods for Rain

## Issues

This week I had many ideas, but no matter what I tried I couldn't it to work. I restarted at least 6 times on the homework assignment and I still have not completed a successful sketch. I knew this week was supposed to be a bit challenging, but I at least thought I could create something simple, but none of it worked. I went through the lesson several times and looked at example code, but mine for some reason wouldn't work. I suppose I'm getting the structure wrong, but I didn't think I was doing anything too different from anyone else. Something must be wrong. I will continue to work on this assignment, but for now you can look at my code to see what I have set up.

## Final Thoughts

I feel disappointed in myself that I couldn't finish this assignment on time and couldn't get it to work. As we progress further, I'm feeling more discouraged as the lessons get harder.
