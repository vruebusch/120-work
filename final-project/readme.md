# **Final Project**

## Summary

I'm so happy that I was able to complete this sketch the way I had originally planned! I would have been disappointed if I had to come up with a new idea. For the most part, I was able to solve any problems I had through watching Shiffman's videos, rereading lessons, and searching the internet. For this project, I utilized local sound, images, Else If statements, and a mousePressed function. The kitten picture is sourced from https://www.lifewithcats.tv/2013/11/11/2-beautiful-sparrow/, the hand is from https://gallery.yopriceville.com/Free-Clipart-Pictures/Hands-PNG/Hand_Clip_Art, the purring sound effect from http://soundbible.com, and the meow is from http://audiosoundclips.com/.

## Steps Taken

I focused on placing adding images to my sketch first--searching for the perfect kitten and hand. Next, I found sound effects to go along with my sketch. Lastly, for the most time consiming part, I worked on the actual code--making the kitten's eyes close when the hand hovers over a certain spot.

## Issues

Honestly, at first, I went about this project all wrong. I tried changing the kitten's eyes from being opened to closed using object interaction, but that wasn't working at all. Finally, I had a breakthrough and thought of something that would be way more simple--Else If statements--and they saved my life. Another thing I had issues with was getting the kitten to purr only when the hand was placed on the belly. I managed to do it, but for some reason the purring sound effect made a horrible echo sound and didn't sound right at all. Maybe Else If statements weren't the best to use for that, but I just eneded up keeping the purr on loop.

## Final Thoughts

I'm so happy that I've finally completed this course. It has been a ride of ups and downs, but I'll definitely be taking experience with me. Every once in a while I would show friends and family some of the sketches I've made and it made me happy when they find them cool. If only they knew how hard and time consuming it was, haha.
