# **Final Project**

## Summary

I'm so happy that I was able to complete this sketch the way I had originally planned! I would have been disappointed if I would have ended up having to think up a new idea because mine didn't work out. For this project, I utilized local sound, images, Else If statements, and a mousePressed function. The kitten picture is sourced from https://www.lifewithcats.tv/2013/11/11/2-beautiful-sparrow/, the purring sound effect from http://soundbible.com, and the meow is from http://audiosoundclips.com/.
