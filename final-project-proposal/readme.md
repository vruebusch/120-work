## **Final Project Proposal**

## Project Concept

For some reason, and this idea just came to me, I want to create some type of interactive game where you simply pet or brush (I haven't decided yet) a cat sitting on your lap. And it will take place from your point of view, looking down at the cat sitting in your lap. When you pet the cat, its eyes will close and it will pur.
## Inspiration

I wanted to make something with animals for my final sketch, but also not extremely complicated, so I think this idea could be simple enough. Some inspiration could come from old internet games I used to play where petting and taking care of animals was involved.
## Issues

Creating the cat and actually making it 'look' like a cat might be complicated. Also making it so when you pet/brush the cat (when your mouse hovers over it, causing it to pur) might be difficult to code.
## Work Plan
Each day I will work on this project little by little so that I will have enough time and won't be stressed out. This will be a big job, at least for me, so I'll need to get started right away.

- First, I'll begin creating the cat
- Second, I'll make a brush or hand to replace the cursor
- Third, I'll create the code where the cat's eyes close when the cursor hovers over it.
- Lastly, I'll create the code where the cat purs (adding a purring sound) when the cursor hovers over it.

## Progress
All I've managed to do so far is make a rough sketch (a literal sketch, in a notebook) of what I want it to look like. Hopefully the final creation won't stray too far from my original idea. If it does, that's okay, too.
